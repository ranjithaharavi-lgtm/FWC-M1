\begin{enumerate}
\item Triangle BCF has a right angle at B. Let A be the point on line CF such that
$FA = FB$ and F lies between A and C. Point D is chosen such that $DA = DC$ and
AD is the bisector of $\angle DAB$. Point E is chosen such that $EA = ED$ and AD
is the bisector of $\angle EAC$. Let M be the midpoint of CF. Let X be the point
such that AMXE is a parallelogram where $AM \parallel EX$ and $AE \parallel MX$.
Prove that the lines BD, FX, and ME are concurrent.

\item Find all positive integers $n$ for which each cell of an $n \times n$ table can
be filled with one of the letters I, M, O such that row, column, and diagonal
conditions are satisfied.

\item Let $P = A_1A_2 \dots A_n$ be a convex polygon with integer-coordinate
vertices on a circle. Let $S$ be its area. If the squares of side lengths are divisible
by an odd integer $v$, prove that $2S$ is divisible by $v$.

\section*{IMO 2016 – Day 2 (Tuesday, July 12, 2016)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A set of positive integers is fragrant if every element shares a prime factor
with another. Let $P(n)=n^2+n+1$. Find the smallest $b$ such that
$\{P(a+1),\dots,P(a+b)\}$ is fragrant.

\item After erasing exactly $k$ linear factors from both sides of
$(x-1)(x-2)\dots(x-2016)$, find the least $k$ such that the equation has no real
solutions.

\item Frogs jump along intersecting segments.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove it is possible if $n$ is odd.
\item Prove it is impossible if $n$ is even.

\section*{IMO 2017 – Day 1 (Tuesday, July 18, 2017)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item For $a_0>1$, define a sequence by a given rule. Determine all values of $a_0$
for which the sequence attains the same value infinitely often.

\item Find all functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying
$f(f(x)f(y)) + f(x+y) = f(xy)$.

\item Hunter and invisible rabbit pursuit problem with bounded tracking error.

\section*{IMO 2018 – Day 2 (Tuesday, July 10, 2018)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A site is any point $(x,y)$ in the plane such that $x$ and $y$ are both
positive integers less than or equal to $20$.

Initially, each of the $400$ sites is unoccupied. Amy and Ben take turns placing
stones, with Amy going first. On her turn, Amy places a new red stone on an
unoccupied site such that the distance between any two sites occupied by red
stones is not equal to $\sqrt{5}$. On his turn, Ben places a new blue stone on an
unoccupied site. (A site occupied by blue stones is allowed to be at any distance
from any other occupied site.) They stop as soon as one player cannot place a
stone.

Find the greatest $K$ such that Amy can ensure that she places at least $K$ red
stones, no matter how Ben places his blue stones.

\item Let $a_1, a_2, \dots$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers. Suppose
that there is an integer $N>1$ such that, for each $n \ge N$, the number
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} + \frac{a_2}{a_3} + \cdots + \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} + \frac{a_n}{a_1}
\]
is an integer. Prove that there is a positive integer $M$ such that
$a_n = a_{n+1}$ for all $n \ge M$.

\item A convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ satisfies
\[
AB \cdot CD = BC \cdot DA.
\]
Point $X$ lies inside $ABCD$ such that
\[
\angle XAB = \angle XCD
\quad \text{and} \quad
\angle XBC = \angle XDA.
\]
Prove that
\[
\angle BXA + \angle DXC = 180^\circ.
\]
